If you're a beginner to networking, you may want to start by reading the [[Intro | Intro]] page.

### TCP

There are two separate libraries available for TCP: **GCDAsyncSocket** and **AsyncSocket**.

AsyncSocket is the older of the two. GCDAsyncSocket is newer, faster and thread-safe. We generally recommend GCDAsyncSocket.

They have very similar API's. In fact GCDAsyncSocket is nearly a drop-in replacement for AsyncSocket.

### UDP

There are two separate libraries available for UDP: **GCDAsyncUdpSocket** and **AsyncUdpSocket**.

AsyncUdpSocket is the older of the two. GCDAsyncUdpSocket is newer, faster and thread-safe. We generally recommend GCDAsyncUdpSocket.
